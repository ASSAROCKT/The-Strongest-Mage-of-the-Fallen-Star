I was summoned by my father.

Born as the eldest son of a marquis family, it has been more than ten years, and I felt my chest pound with anticipation, thinking that at last, the time had come. I walked through the familiar halls of Ortenatris Castle.

Thinking about what lay ahead, my steps naturally grew lighter.

Passing by the rear garden with its fountain, I proceeded along the western corridor, ascended the grand staircase from the spacious entrance hall adorned with a large stained glass window.

After walking about a hundred meters along the second-floor corridor, I arrived at the office of my father, Marquis Ortenos.

I knocked on the door and entered.

“Father-sama, it is Shalca. I have arrived as requested.”

“So, you have come, Shalca. Take a seat on the sofa.”

“Yes.”

Upon entering the room, a voice called out from a middle-aged man with silver-ash hair, exuding a dignified air.  

Following his words, I sat down on the sofa and the man also took a seat across the table from me.

Radnark de Ortenos, thirty-five years old.

He is my father.

Father let out a sigh, looking somewhat weary.

From his demeanor, I could tell that he was troubled over some problem that needed solving.

“Shalca, though you were born as the eldest son of the Ortenos marquisate, you are the child of a concubine. Therefore, it is only natural that you cannot inherit the family headship. You understand this, do you not?”

For a moment, I thought this was going to be a heavy-handed confession but it turned out otherwise.

“Yes. I have already heard it so many times that my ears might grow calluses from it. Someone like me wandering around inside the castle would surely cause those fools from Nevilim to start making a ruckus, so I am constantly on edge about it.”

It is well known that despite being the eldest son of the Ortenos marquisate, I cannot inherit its title.

Still, I make it clear that I bear no grudges and that I have nothing to do with my mother’s family, the Nevilim.

“It does not matter. Baron Nevilim has no such ambition. As for you, Shalca, I would like nothing more than to send you, as I once did your grandfather, to fight in an outside war so you could earn military merit. However, if I did that, it would be difficult to keep the Lanecki count family in check. That house is the sort that, should you be elevated even slightly, would immediately demand that Ermia be returned to her family home.”

The Lanecki count family was the most powerful noble house in the Ortenos region and it was the family of my father’s legal wife.

If what Father said was true, then there would be no path for me to live my life as a warrior from here on.

“I understand Father-sama’s hardships.”

“Mm. For the time being, since one cannot be recognized as an adult without earning merit on the battlefield, I must soon send you to your first campaign. Shalca, do you have any particular wish?”

“No, nothing in particular…”

I had reached this age without ever going to war, but whenever I saw Grandfather being doted on by young women, I could not help but feel envious.

A scrawny weakling generally did not attract attention in this era, so I thought I ought to do something about it. However, as Father had said earlier, because of the matter of succession, I could not allow myself to stand out too much.

At this rate, I might end up growing into a scrawny weakling unfit for a noble.

“Sigh… Shalca, are you truly fine with that?”

“What do you mean by『fine with that』?”

“You were born the eldest son of the Ortenos marquisate. I am asking why you possess so little ambition.”

Even when asked about ambition, seeing my father in such an exhausted state left me with neither the spirit nor the drive to think,『I am the rightful next family head!』

Still, Father probably found such an attitude of mine incomprehensible.

“No, I am fine as I am. It is only natural that Lady Ermia… no, Ermia-sama, the daughter of the legal wife, has the right of succession. Given that, how could I possibly harbor ambition? The fact that I have been able to live without the slightest inconvenience until now is entirely thanks to the Ortenos family. In a household already troubled by disorder, how could I possibly bring about discord?”

“Truly. If you were willing, I would even consider suppressing the Lanecki to pass the family headship to you.”

For some reason, Father looked at me with a serious expression, harboring some mysterious expectation.

There were various things that came to mind, but given that my reputation outside the family was abysmal, I doubted that a man like Father—who tended to listen to the opinions of those around him—could make such a bold decision.

“That will not be necessary. I humbly ask that you refrain from such considerations.”

“I see…”

When I voiced my refusal, Father looked somewhat disappointed.

But I truly had no desire to get into an inheritance dispute with my own family.

Even as a marquis family, there were many entanglements and as far as the Ortenos house was concerned, it held far more grotesque and sordid circumstances than most other noble houses.

It was the sort of deep darkness that made the idea of reforming the system nearly impossible without extraordinary resolve.

‘That said, I really wish he would just get to the main topic already…’

Wanting to change the mood a bit, I cleared my throat with a small cough.

“By the way, once you have gone through your first campaign, you will be considered an adult as a noble. It would not be strange for you to have a partner by then.”

“Yes, that is true!”

“...Shalca, as it happens, a suitable marriage proposal has just arrived for you…”

Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes—this is it!

A few months ago, Father had mentioned that he was making arrangements for my marriage.

I had been dying to know the outcome, so much so that I had lost sleep over it until today.

When I was summoned by Father, I was certain it was about the marriage proposal.

“I have been waiting for this, Father-sama.”

“...What is the matter, Shalca? You are suddenly leaning forward.”

“Please tell me— do I know the young lady in question?”

“No, I believe you do not.”

If I did not know her, that likely meant she was from outside the Ortenos region.

I mean, I am the eldest son of the Ortenos marquis, so surely he would choose a reliable young lady for me, right?

Ordinarily, one would expect a well-educated, properly bred, and lovely daughter of a noble family to be chosen. Yes, I shall believe that.

At the very least, could he not show me a portrait of her?

“So then, Father-sama, is that young lady cute?”

“Hm, so you are curious about your potential fiancée, Shalca. Well, it was all for nothing in the end but I suppose I can at least let you see her portrait.”

When I asked Father with a sharp, expectant look, he showed me a single picture.

‘Mm… she is adorable…’

The girl in the portrait wore a long, resplendent dress—something female nobles rarely chose—paired with makeup like faint red upon the first snowfall, making her look almost ghostly as she sat in a chair.

There sat a blushing young maiden, about my own age, in the prime of her beauty.

With snow-white skin, crimson-tinted cheeks and lips, and long hair of a pale blue hue, she could be none other than a young lady of the Roshum marquisate.

‘This lovely maiden is to be my fiancée… this is the life of a winner…!’

Her features were still a little youthful, yet so strikingly beautiful that she would surely grow into a great beauty in the future.

Already, I was plotting a brilliant future with the yet-unseen girl, my imagination swelling.

“Father-sama, let us arrange the formal meeting right away. Naturally, you are not thinking of making me a son-in-law in her house, so we will establish a branch family, yes? Leave it to me. I, Shalca, will devote myself to the glorious restoration of the Ortenos name!”

I had renewed my resolve to strengthen the Ortenos house even more through this engagement—

“—Unfortunately, it was called off at the last moment.”

With merciless swiftness, Father’s words shredded my heart to pieces.

“Eh, w–what… Wh-why…?”

I could not accept the reality and rushed to press Father for answers.

Having seen the portrait of that lovely girl, all I felt now was the bitter regret of letting the perfect catch slip away.

What in the world had happened?

“It seems the other party fell ill.”

“F–fell ill? …Come to think of it, wasn’t there something like this before? That incident where, on the way here, the coachman was suddenly knocked unconscious by an intense magical pressure? And in the end, the culprit was never found and the whole thing was called off?”

About a year ago, a noble family in alliance with ours had made a marriage proposal, but on the way to Ortenatris for the meeting, they were attacked on the road by a mysterious wave of magical force.

In the end, the identity of the one who unleashed the pressure was never discovered, and the engagement was broken off.

“Ah, yes, that was the case. This time, the Roshum marquisate seemed unusually eager and it was on track to be finalized. But just as I was about to discuss the meeting, a sudden letter of refusal arrived. Its contents were full of apologies and strange phrases like『our understanding was shallow.』”

“『Our understanding was shallow』?”

“Yes. From the way it was written, it seems Lady Lokina believes she is not worthy to stand at your side, and has taken it to heart.”

Saying that, Father handed me all the letters sent by Lady Lokina.

From them came the pleasant scent of Brunigera, a flower native to the northern Roshum region.

She had likely extracted the flower’s essence and sprinkled it onto the letters.

Lady Lokina truly seemed to be a refined, thoughtful, and lovely young woman.

“…This sounds like the standard wording for politely rejecting someone you are not interested in.”

“That is probably the case.”

From the contents, it was clear she had intentionally used expressions like『it would be presumptuous』so as not to hurt my honor.

The illness was likely just a pretext.

So, I had been rejected… by Lady Lokina, without even meeting her.

‘…No, I cannot give up here. That would make me no different from my past life.’

“Father-sama, this must be some mistake. Let us send another letter right away.”

“Even if you say that, it seems the other side is determined to completely withdraw.”

Something felt off. Could another noble have interfered?

Given that both sides were great noble houses, politics would inevitably be involved in any engagement.

It bothered me how the other party had suddenly changed their attitude, as if disregarding everything until now.

Of course, it could simply be a matter of personal preference, but I could not shake the feeling that some unseen force was working to prevent the engagement from happening.

“In that case, may I send her a letter myself? Then perhaps meet her in person to talk—”

“You are persistent, Shalca. A noble must know when to withdraw.”

“…Okay.”

So it was no good. If it was a decision agreed upon between noble houses, there was nothing I could do.

It was truly disappointing, but this too was part of the fate I had to accept for being born a noble.

“Father-sama, then what of my marriage prospects?”

“Hm. At present, there is still no prospect in sight.”

‘Kah…!’

The shock was so great that I sank to my knees on the marble floor.

It had been two years since I first spoke to Father about needing to do something about the ever-growing, uncontrollable urges typical of adolescence.

Last time, when I thought I had finally found a marriage prospect, the engagement was broken off right before the meeting due to an attack by some unknown assailant.

And now, just when things seemed to be going well, it was broken off again because of the other party’s illness.

“…Father-sama, it is not that I am disliked, is it?”

“Mm. Shalca, your…『eccentric』behavior in the castle town is well known within the castle. I have done my best to suppress the rumors but it is not impossible that they have reached the other party.”

“S-surely not. My visits to the castle town were all for the good of Ortenos…”

“That is why I told you, did I not? For a noble to associate with commoners carries such risks…”

I knew that by frequently visiting the castle town, some less-than-favorable rumors about me had spread within the castle.

But if those rumors had now reached the point of affecting my marriage prospects, then it had completely backfired.

What frustrated me most was that I was not being fairly evaluated.

Before I realized it, I was clenching my fists so tightly they trembled, my lips biting down hard…

—The air froze, as if drawn taut.

The next instant, the room echoed with a high-pitched tone, like the wail of space itself, accompanied by a sharp ringing in my ears.

The magic lamp on Father’s desk began to flicker, and ripples formed in the ink within the inkpot as it shook.

Seeing the quill in his hand begin to tremble faintly, Father realized what was happening.

When he turned his gaze to me, there was clear urgency written on his face.

“I–impossible! Shalca, calm yourself, do not let your emotions run wild in a place like this! Your magic… it is leaking out!”

The moment the objects around us began to faintly tremble, Father’s words snapped me back to my senses.

“Ha! M-my deepest apologies…!”

At Father’s reprimand, I quickly regained my composure and the vibrations in the surroundings subsided.

“Good. If your magic were to pressure someone, it would be intolerable. As a noble, if you cannot control your emotions, you will be seen as immature and humiliated in society. Your magic capacity is already abnormal as it is, so take great care.”

I had been scolded by Father.

As someone born with an enormous amount of magic, I had been constantly told to keep my emotions under strict control, but it seemed I was still lacking.

When I let my emotions show too much, as just now, I would unconsciously release magic, exposing a clear weakness both as a noble and as a mage.

“Yes. I will engrave this into my heart.”

“Mm. The matter of the engagement was truly unfortunate. …By the way, Shalca, what would you think of attending the academy this autumn?”

Father’s proposal came as a complete surprise.

Institutions called『academies』existed in several places in the Empire, but the one he meant was most likely the Zakrian Noble Academy in the imperial capital.

“The academy, you say. To be honest, I have little interest. If I, one of Ortenos’s『guardians』were to leave, it would create a large gap in our defenses, giving other houses a chance to exploit us. And besides, this is also the year Lady Ermia will be enrolling, is it not?”

Unfortunately, the situation surrounding the Ortenos territory was tense, and even losing one young noble like me would greatly weaken its defenses.

If, while I was away at the academy, Ortenos were to be destroyed, it would all be for nothing.

“What you say has merit, Shalca. However, remaining within the territory will make it difficult for you to find a wife.”

“…” 

From his tone, I could tell Father’s search for my bride had hit a dead end.

No doubt, my free-spirited activities in the castle town were still casting a shadow.


Still, if that was the case, perhaps going to the distant western imperial capital, where I was unknown, might not be such a bad idea.

“I see. So, if I were to find a young lady I like at the academy, I could bring her back to the territory.”

“Heh, exactly. Officially, I am considering sending you as an attendant to Ermia.”

Seeing the slightly scheming look on Father’s face, I realized my guess had been correct.

But what exactly did he mean by being Lady Ermia’s attendant?

“Lady Ermia’s attendant, you say?”

“Yes…I do not like to say this, but if both Ermia, the Ortenos family’s eldest daughter and next head and you, the eldest son without succession rights, were sent at the same time, it could cause confusion at the academy. If no precautions are taken, there will certainly be fools trying to cozy up to you.”

Father spoke to me with a slightly hesitant tone.

“I see. By setting the hierarchy in advance, you are making it clear to those around us that Lady Ermia is the next family head.”

“Mm, forgive me, but that is correct. Ermia is gifted as both a noble and a mage but in social matters, she is still a step behind other young nobles who have been trained daily in practical affairs. The academy is a den where many rivals gather—she will be thoroughly tempered there.”

I understood then. Father had decided to send Ermia to the academy to train her.

A rather bold move.

“Shalca, you must be especially cautious. Even though they are young nobles, all of them will possess Stella-class magic power. No matter how beautiful a young lady may be, you must never agree to an invitation to become a son-in-law.”

“A beautiful young lady… Of… of course. My loyalty lies solely with Ortenos. Against such schemes, I, Shalca, will send them away without even a blink.”


For a moment, I imagined a lovely young lady like Lady Lokina pleading,『Will you come to my house?』and felt my face begin to soften but I managed to hold it back at the last moment.

“Hm. You do seem slightly shaken but since Ermia will be with you, it should not be much of an issue. …That girl has grown strong since losing her mother. I sense in her a strong will to inherit Ortenos at a young age and forge strong connections within and without. You must support Ermia as well.”

“Ha! Naturally. I, Shalca, will be Lady Ermia’s sword and shield.”

“…”

I extended my index and middle fingers sharply and held them before my heart.

It was the noble salute passed down from the former Ortenos royal family.

For some reason, Father fell silent with a faintly melancholy expression.

“Is something wrong, Father-sama?”

“I just thought… you did not used to call Ermia『-sama』so formally. She may be your half-sister but she is still the same age as you. You were once so close—why have you started addressing her so distantly?”

Father seemed shocked by my manner toward Ermia.

But this was something that could only be explained by the fact that I had reached an age where things had to change.

I could no longer treat her like some cute relative’s daughter forever.

…Or so I tried to explain, though it came out sounding a bit odd.

“It’s the times, I suppose. Both Lady Ermia and I have had no choice but to change.”

I narrowed my eyes, looking off into the distance with a solemn expression.

“I see… Forgive me. I had hoped our wars would not need to be passed down to your generation.”

‘Hm?’

For some reason, Father began to speak of his regrets and resentment toward the negative legacy left by the older generation.

“Father-sama, that’s not it.”

“Hm? Then what is it?”

“I mean that Lady Ermia is a young woman of age now, so she is difficult to deal with—that’s all.”

“…”

Ah, this was bad. The atmosphere had turned awkward.

It felt like the complaint of a middle-aged office worker who didn’t know how to deal with a much younger female colleague.

Well… in terms of mental age, perhaps that wasn’t entirely wrong.

“…Well, never mind. But if the two of you are to go to the academy, there is one concern.”

“A concern, Father-sama?”

Father seemed intent on ignoring my foolish remark and continued.

“Yes. With two Stella-class nobles absent from Ortenos, there is a chance the eastern front could collapse.”

“Ah, I see. That was your worry.”

The east…meaning that country to the east of the Ortenos territory.

“Even with your grandfather’s watchful eye holding them in check, it is only a matter of time before they make a move. We may be better off striking them thoroughly once more.”

The『grandfather』Father referred to was my own grandfather.

I understood then—this was the issue that had been troubling Father since this morning.

“So in other words…?”

“As it happens, there is a task perfect for your first campaign. Shalca, can I trust you with it?”

At last—my first campaign.

It was unlikely to be a grand battle that could bring great merit.

Most likely, it would be something like mediating a minor skirmish near the border, with enemies no stronger than Satella-class knights.

“Ha! Leave it to me.”

Once again, I gave Father the Ortenos-style salute.
