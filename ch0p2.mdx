On the morning of my first campaign, I stood on the balcony of Ortenatris Castle, absentmindedly gazing at the military officers and soldiers busily moving about in front of the castle gates.

They were all the men Father had entrusted to me.

I looked at each face in turn, steeling my mind for the battlefield ahead.

“My first campaign, huh.”

This would be my first time experiencing battle since coming to this world.

Perhaps I was feeling a little sentimental, as memories of my past life resurfaced.

Back then, I was nothing more than a plain office worker whose only hobby was occasionally leafing through science magazines at the bookstore.

One day, I suddenly collapsed at work and when I came to, I was an infant, suckling at my JK mother’s breast.

It was probably death from overwork.

In my later years, I had been so far gone that the only joy I could find was in tossing stones into a river and I never imagined that after death I would be reincarnated in another world.

And yet here I was, about to set foot on a battlefield—there was something profoundly moving about that.

“Shalca.”

I had no real talent to speak of, except perhaps for the ability to work my body to the bone.

Born into a great noble house, I was taught the family’s fierce history, learned about magic, trained my body in its use, and even learned how to kill, coughing up blood in the process.

Steeped in Ortenos education, I had somehow developed a strong sense of belonging, despite this being my second life.

Perhaps I was just too simple-minded.

If I had refused, I could have avoided this but since I accepted everything so readily, Father, Mother, my master Ojiji-sama, and Lady Elena—Ermia’s mother—probably assumed I could handle anything.

“Hey, Shalca.”

Truly, that black company that stole my blooming thirties was unforgivable.

The sin of instilling in me such a high tolerance for pain and mental strain was a heavy one.

And those people would go on walking the path of demons without ever having to bear the burden of my death.

Still, there was no point in grumbling about what had already passed.

This grudge could never be avenged, but I would have to overcome it and step forward into a new self.

“Shalca, are you listening to me?”

Thus I resolved to live for love and happiness.

Since I had been given a fresh start in a new world, I would achieve the things I could never have in my past life.

Namely—to find and spend my life with a lovely woman who could make my heart pound.

And to live happily with that lovely wife.

My engagement plans had not gone well, but the future was still ahead.

I had Father’s approval to search for a bride at the academy, and my prospects were bright.

I just had to finish this first campaign quickly and plan how to maneuver well at the academy.

“Hey, you! Can you not hear that Lady Ermia is speaking to you?”

“Huh?”

It seemed I had been spacing out. I didn’t realize I was being addressed until a man grabbed my shoulder from behind.

Turning around, I saw a group of nobles in ostentatious dress, along with their attendants.

‘Hm, there’s one face I haven’t seen before.’

Other than one, I recognized all of the nobles.

The unfamiliar one was a young man in his late teens with striking orange hair.

‘Well, if he can get into Ortenatris Castle, he must be connected to some house or another.’

At the center of the group stood a lovely girl with long white hair, positioned like the mistress of them all.

She spoke to me with a slightly displeased expression.

“What are you daydreaming about when you’re about to head out for your first campaign?”

Her name was Ermia la Ortenos—my beloved younger sister.

She had the same golden eyes as me, long lashes inherited from our mother, and a clean, sharp jawline.

Her unblemished white skin peeked out between a black miniskirt and long socks, and the white robe she wore, embroidered with golden thread down to the shins, gave her an air somehow reminiscent of a cleric.

“Ha, my apologies. I was lost in thought for a moment.”

“Well, fine. More importantly, Shalca, don’t you have something to say to me?”
Her tone carried a slight edge—Ermia did not seem to be in a very good mood.

With her left hand on her hip, she twirled the white tips of her hair around a finger of her right hand, looking at me with clear dissatisfaction.

![Illustration](https://i.redd.it/37iz6sy94shf1.jpg)

I tilted my head slightly at Ermia’s question but had no idea what she meant.

“My apologies, Ermia-sama. I have no idea what you’re referring to.”

“Think carefully. Why would I come all the way here to stand in front of you? Think. Carefully.”

“Ermia-sama, are you… perhaps angry?”

“If you think so, then try figuring out why I’m angry.”

Her tone was a bit high-handed, but she was my sister and cute, so I could absolutely forgive her.

…No, that’s not the point.

Just what was Ermia so upset about?

After thinking it over, my gray brain cells arrived at a possible answer.

“Aah, could it be that you’re on your p—”

“Why is it that, even though you’re about to head out for your first campaign, you haven’t come to report to me?”

‘Ah…’

I had debated telling Ermia, but since I wasn’t heading into a desperate, life-or-death battle, I figured it would be fine not to bother.

In truth, this first campaign wasn’t going to be much of a battle anyway.

“My apologies, Ermia-sama. I simply thought that for something as minor as my first campaign, I shouldn’t trouble you with it.”

“Oh? And why is that? I am the next head of the Ortenos marquisate. You, Shalca, naturally have a duty to report such things to me.”

“My apologies, Ermia-sama. I was utterly unaware of such a duty. I’ll make sure to report to you from now on, so please forgive me.”

I honestly had no idea such a duty even existed.
I bowed my head repeatedly to Ermia.

Seeing me like that, Ermia’s cheeks flushed faintly and she showed a smug little smile.

It might seem like a strange relationship for a half-sister to have her older brother bowing so deferentially to her. We used to speak far more casually, but at some point, things naturally settled into this current dynamic.

“Of course. I am, after all, the one who will stand above you in the future, Shalca, am I not?”

“Of course, Ermia-sama.”

“Uf-fun. As the superior, it is my responsibility to keep track of your activities at all times. Naturally, you understand that, don’t you, Shalca?”

When it came to me, Ermia clearly tried to act the part of a superior.

If she was doing this because she saw me as her biggest rival for the position of family head, it was a little sad as an older brother.

Still, she was such a lovely sister that I could forgive her for anything—that was probably my personal weakness.

“Ermia-sama, when you say『at all times』…?”

“At all times means at all times. You will tell me everything—where you are, what you are doing, and who you plan to meet, every single day. For example, if you are approached with a marriage proposal, you must consult me first. As the next family head, I must consider many things.”

Even the most capable female project manager wouldn’t demand such strict reporting.

Just how wary of me was she?

“Ermia-tan, that’s a bit much, don’t you think…”

“—Tan?”

Ah. I realized I had called her by her old nickname out of habit.

Ermia caught it instantly, her sharp gaze locking on me.
“M-my apologies, Ermia-sama.”

“That’s right. Since I am your『superior』you must not speak to me like that! Be careful from now on, Shalca.”

The way she emphasized the word superior made her attachment to the idea clear.

It wasn’t quite a landmine, but Ermia would immediately correct me whenever I addressed her too familiarly.

Still, when she did so, there was something spirited—almost triumphant—in her demeanor. Maybe that was just my brotherly bias talking.

“Yes. It is my earnest wish to report to you daily, but… it is not easy to find an opportunity to present matters to you, Ermia-sama.”

We were nobles of opposite genders, and because of that, our living spaces rarely overlapped. Even if she demanded reports, it wasn’t easy to deliver them.

“I see. Then from now on, come to my bedchamber at fire-lighting time.”
Fire-lighting time—meaning evening.

“Your bedchamber?”

“Yes. Is there some problem with that?”

Though she asked it as a question, her eyes clearly said, If you think there’s a problem, go ahead and say it.

As her brother, I couldn’t help but worry about her sense of chastity, so I decided to offer a small lecture.

“Well… it’s just that, for an unmarried lady to invite a man into her bedchamber, it might not look very proper.”

“If I say it’s fine, then it’s fine. Besides, you’re my Onii-sama, Shalca, so it shouldn’t matter, should it? Or… could it be you intend to do something improper to me?”

Ermia gave me a teasing smile.

If she went that far, I could hardly object to slipping into her bedchamber.

She was my beloved sister, yes—but before that, she was a beautiful young maiden.

Refusing such an invitation would go against my convictions.

“In that case, Ermia-sama, I gladly accept.”

“Good. You just have to listen to what I tell you, my Shalca.”

Saying this, Ermia stroked my cheek.

Her flushed expression looked almost intoxicated.

The young noblemen standing behind her twisted their faces in obvious displeasure, nearly grinding their teeth at the sight of her touching me so intimately.

“Understood.”

Ignoring those young nobles, I gave the Ortenos-style salute.

“Knowing you, Shalca, I’m not too worried about your first campaign. But be careful—people from Lanecki say the western front has been getting a bit tense.”

“By the western front of Lanecki… you mean the Darbonnie marquisate?”

“Yes. It’s strange for them to be making moves just as the eastern front is growing restless.”

As Ermia spoke with a faint note of suspicion, one of the nobles behind her stepped forward.

“This is most unpleasant to hear, Lady Ermia.”

The one who spoke was the orange-haired young noble I hadn’t recognized earlier.

Of medium build and height, he looked a little older than me, and slightly taller than both myself and Ermia, who were still in our growth years.

“Oh? Did I say something wrong, Lord Dinoren?”

“Not at all. We of Darbonnie have no intent to oppose Ortenos or Lanecki. There may have been minor misunderstandings in the past, but now that we’ve been allowed to join the Ortenos regional lords’ assembly as the lowest seat of Darbonnie, let us foster a friendly relationship—both in public and in private.”

The noble youth called Dinoren said this as he took Ermia’s hand.

Seeing that, I felt a flicker in my eyelids as a wave of instinctive dislike welled up from deep in my gut.

‘Dinoren de Darbonnie…’

A member of the Darbonnie marquisate—one of the Empire’s Five Great Marquis Houses.

I had never heard his name before, so he was probably from a branch family.

“I see no reason to meet with you, Lord Dinoren. You hold no title even within Darbonnie.”

Ermia smiled thinly as she pulled her hand away from his grasp.

Her unspoken message was clear—a so-called 『guardian』should not overstep.

“My, my, how cold you are…”

Even after being shaken off, Dinoren kept up a nonchalant front, but his expression betrayed a thinly veiled irritation.

“Do not lay your filthy hands on Ermia, you cur!”

A red-haired young man, built like a rugby player and a head taller than me, stepped between Ermia and Dinoren.

It was just like a knight shielding a princess from the clutches of a villain.

“Oh my, Lord Jilga, and in what capacity do you presume to say such a thing?”

The red-haired man’s name was Jilga de Lanecki, second son of the Lanecki count family and the man chosen as Ermia’s fiancé.

“Naturally, as Ermia’s fiancé. And you, Darbonnie, what is the meaning of sending some branch family whelp here? You conniving little snake whose only skill is to coil around and cling.”

“My, my, it wounds me to be called that by a『hornless sheep.』It seems you’ve learned some sly tricks—like making your former master serve as a shield for an enemy nation. You were far more endearing back when you were still a ferocious beast.”

The Lanecki family’s emblem was a proud black goat with magnificent horns.

To be likened to a sheep was the greatest insult to Lanecki.

“…What was that? I’d say your vaunted『shield』has rusted away over these past sixty years. I can just picture you hanging your head in embarrassment, stripped of your eastern-guard position at the Imperial court gatherings.”

“Such baseless speculation…!”

The Darbonnie marquisate and the Lanecki count family had been enemies more than sixty years ago and even now they were like cats and dogs.

Even as fellow nobles of the Empire, the grudge had never vanished.

“Now, now, both of you, there’s no need to get so heated. This is a rare day for the lords’ assembly, after all, so let’s not start a fight now.”

A boy with black hair cut in a prim, pageboy style stepped in to mediate, wearing a friendly smile.

He was Encante de Nevilim, the next head of House Nevilim and a little younger than me.

The lords’ assembly was a monthly meeting where the heads and heirs of the four great noble houses at the heart of the Ortenos region gathered.

They had been staying in Ortenatris for several days already, and were probably on their way to the venue now.

“It’s been a while, Encante. Is Lord Eucrane at the castle today?”

“Tch, he is not.”

“I see… I had wanted to offer my greetings.”

When I spoke to Encante, he clicked his tongue at me.

It was nothing unusual, so I didn’t pay it much mind.

“Lord Shalca, you live quite a charmed life, don’t you? You spend your days wandering outside the castle among the lowborn and yet just because you are her brother, you’re allowed to remain at Lady Ermia’s side.”

“Ah, yes, truly an honor.”

“Tch! How dare you act so smug when you’re nothing but a useless eater!”

“Well, I can’t help it, can I?”

Though technically a relative, Encante bore me intense hostility.
Apparently, he had fallen in love with Ermia at first sight, and thus regarded me, her brother, as his mortal enemy.

As the next head of his house, it wasn’t as if he could marry Ermia anyway.

This was why noble love affairs were such a nuisance.

“It is true, Lord Shalca—you are rumored even in my lands as the『foolish eldest son』. It would be good if this first campaign could wash away at least some of that talk. By the way, what exactly does this first campaign entail?”

Jilga said this with a wicked grin.

“…Five thousand from the Ortenos army to subjugate two thousand Naia troops of Satella-class or lower, who have occupied a village near the border.”

Since it was technically a military matter, I met Ermia’s eyes first to make sure she had no particular reaction before revealing the details of the order.

“Pfft—Taaahhahahahaha! This is priceless, Lord Shalca. Five thousand men, including Stella-class, just to defeat two thousand Satella-class or less? What kind of joke is that?”

“Father probably wanted to be thorough, given that the Naia army’s movements near the border seemed suspicious.”

“Kukuku… Even so, five thousand is far too cautious. No, wait—I understand now. It’s because you, Lord Shalca, are untrustworthy as a commander, so they padded the numbers to ensure the army could function even with you in charge.”

So that was his game—Jilga had brought up my first campaign just to mock me.

No doubt for the same reason as Encante—both saw me as a target.

‘…Big body, but a petty, slimy bastard.’

“Lord Shalca… I do hope you achieve some glorious result, gufufu. Though if you need five thousand to take down two thousand, you’ll be a laughingstock as a noble, won’t you? Gufufufuh.”

Encante followed Jilga’s lead, his smirk brimming with contempt.

I was certain he called me by name alone behind my back.

“…Lord Shalca, as Ermia’s fiancé, I do not wish to say this to her brother but I must ask that you refrain from having further contact with her.”

Jilga looked down at me, his glare like a gangster’s menacing stare.

“That is…”

“Oh? And why is that, Lord Jilga?”

Before I could respond, Ermia did—her voice outwardly polite, yet cold enough to chill the air.

“Naturally, because this man brings nothing but harmful influence to you, Ermia. Wasn’t he once placed under house arrest for defending the crimes of those Dust rabble even within the castle? Lord Radnark may be lenient but in Lanecki, such conduct unbecoming of a noble would never be tolerated.”

“…”

“Lord Shalca is, regrettably, immature as a noble—a failure with no proper mindset. To have such a person loitering around Ermia is intolerable.”

Jilga’s face was as hard and unyielding as rock as he spoke, his words flowing without pause.

It was true that in the past, I had intervened behind the scenes to help people who had been wrongfully imprisoned.

In this world, nobles were the highest authority, and for one to side with the weak was unthinkable—seen as softness, weakness.

‘That time, the backlash was far stronger than I expected. It even shocked me.’

Even my mild-mannered father had scolded me over it.

In short, I had no title, but a reputation for disgrace—that was the『Fool of Ortenos』.

“It doesn’t matter what your circumstances are. No matter what anyone says, I will do only what’s necessary for Ortenos—for Ermia-sama.”

I faced Jilga with unwavering resolve.

I had decided I would support Ermia, and no matter what Lanecki’s precious noble heir said, it wouldn’t change that.

“You mean you can’t do as I say? Know your place! You’re nothing but a hindrance—not only to Lanecki and Ortenos, but even to Nevilim!”

“…Guh.”

Jilga grabbed me by the collar and lifted me up with one hand.

The noble-born strength behind his grip made it hard to breathe.

“Or perhaps I should teach you the difference in our strength right here and now!”

As he spoke, he let the flame-like crest on his right hand flicker into view…

“…Stop! Lord Jilga!”

After a moment of hesitation, Ermia stepped in to stop him.

The reason she couldn’t be forceful with Jilga was simple—despite Ortenos outranking Lanecki in noble rank, Lanecki’s actual military power was overwhelming.

It was a complicated matter, rooted in historical circumstances.

“Don’t stop me, Ermia. This is all for your sake. Can’t you see? It’s your overly strong attachment to Lord Shalca that’s the problem. It pains me to cause your brother suffering but I won’t stop until you understand. So you should take this as a chance to reconsider what it means to be a noble, and learn it well.”

“…Fine, just please… don’t bully my brother any more…”

Ermia pleaded with Jilga, and right there, she began to cry helplessly.

Gone was the image of the confident future head—she was just a fragile girl.

‘Ah, geez…’

Ermia had always been an empathetic child.

Whenever I was treated poorly, she would always end up crying with me.

Each time, I had stayed by her side until her tears stopped.

‘If she keeps doing this, I worry whether she’ll be able to manage as the next family head.’

“Ermia, you mustn’t cry in a place like this. As a noble, you must learn to be detached. You have a fiancé already, and it is unacceptable for you to pay attention to any other man—yes, even if he is your brother! If you continue to be so familiar with Lord Shalca, then you’ll have to—ow!”

I gripped the arm Jilga was using to hold me by the collar.

I didn’t break any bones but I squeezed hard enough to leave a mark and his strength slackened.

“Ermia-sama, are you all right?”

I pulled a handkerchief from my pocket and gently wiped away her tears.

Her eyes were reddened and glistening, carrying a fragile beauty—like a dusting of snow warmed by a faint light.

“I’m fine. What about you, Onii-sama?”

“Yes. Though, Ermia-sama… your way of addressing me has gone back to how it used to be.”

“Ah… Shalca, your collar is crooked.”

Ermia, looking a little embarrassed, reached out and straightened the crumpled collar of my clothing.

“Thank you.”

“It’s fine. Making sure one’s subordinates are properly presentable is part of a superior’s duty, after all.”

She said this with a small, shy smile. It seemed she had already regained her usual composure.

“—!”

Jilga was clutching his arm, face red as he ground his teeth. Whether it was because he was her fiancé or not, his obsession with Ermia was abnormal.

It seemed he made a habit of this kind of noble harassment toward her.

‘If he keeps laying hands on Ermia, it might be better to 『deal with』him somewhere down the line.’

While Jilga and I stood there radiating an air of imminent violence, a young noblewoman timidly raised her hand to speak.
“Um… everyone, is it really okay to keep hanging around with the foolish Shalca-san? I think it’s almost time for the assembly to start.”

The one who spoke without the slightest regard for the tense atmosphere was a girl with long, lustrous purple hair flowing down her back: Carlotta la Elsheen, heir to the Elsheen viscountcy.

The impressive fullness of her figure was evident even through her clothing, clearly inherited from her mother, the current head.

Among the heirs, she was one of the older ones, though there were rumors she might be a bit of an airhead.

“Y-yes, you’re right, perhaps we should head to the venue…”

Encante, swept along by her words, agreed.

“Ermia… if you keep associating with that fool, I’ll have to take measures of my own…!”

Jilga spat his parting words like a jealous stalker before stomping away in irritation.
“Not quite as the rumors described. You seem rather shrewd, Lord Shalca. You’ve piqued my interest.”

Dinoren said this from above, figuratively speaking.

I had little desire to deal with him, but…

“…I see. My thanks.”

“If you like, give me some of your time another day. Let’s talk, just the two of us.”

“Yes… if the opportunity arises.”

This orange-haired young man remained unreadable to the end.

I wasn’t sure if I would meet him again but he seemed like someone to whom I should not easily open my heart.

“Shalca, you’re strong but don’t get carried away. I’m sure you understand.”

Ermia’s expression turned a little solemn.

Ah, I see. She was telling me not to achieve too much in my first campaign.

“Of course, Ermia-sama.”

“Fufu, as long as you understand. Make sure you listen to what Getrard says. You’re a bit reckless, Shalca.”

“Yes, understood.”

“And…yes, I wish you good fortune in battle, Onii-sama.”

“…”

Ermia whispered Onii-sama into my ear, then placed a kiss on my cheek.

With that, she turned on her heel and left the balcony, her entourage following in tow.

“…What was that about?”

Recalling the soft touch of her lips on my cheek filled me with a strange blend of happiness and embarrassment.
I almost let a goofy grin spread across my face but with iron will, I forced my expression to stay firm.

For now, it was time to take my first step toward my very first campaign—
